# to-do

List of fix-ables:
1. Project title and project description cut off in the docket page when they are too long
2. ^ Same with to-dos and checklists (they cut off weird)
3. Adding of checklist is not super intuitive (it works though)
4. Maybe make the to-do icons appear when the to-do is hovered
5. When adding a to-do, make the priority be a choice of radio buttons
6. Make priority and due date visible in the project page (don't know in what form yet)
7. Use date-fns for due dates
8. Save data in local computer
9. Improve layout of modals
10. When clicking / viewing to-dos, the space where you can click is only on the text, sometimes it doesn't work


Lessons learned:

1. Use a unique id instead of index
2. Separate code early
3. Remove event listeners of modals , so that there are no duplicates of event listeners
